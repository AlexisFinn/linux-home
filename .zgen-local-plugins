# The Zsh Starter Kit allows you to replace the curated plugins list it
# ships with with a custom one by creating a file named .zgen-local-plugins.
#
# This is to make it easier to customize without having to maintain a separate
# fork of the starter kit.
#
# This example file duplicates the list of plugins that shipped with the
# kit as of 2017-05-07.
